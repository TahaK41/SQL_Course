-- Situation 1:
-- We have two staff members, with Staff IDs 1 and 2. We want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments (most in terms of number of payments processed, not total dollar amount).
-- How many payments did each staff member handle and who gets the bonus?

-- Answer:
SELECT staff_id,COUNT(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id
-- Staff ID 1 = 7292 and Staff ID 2 = 7304, therefore the staff member with ID 2 receives the bonus.

-- Situation 2:
-- Corporate HQ is conducting a study on the relationship between replacement cost and a movie MPAA rating (e.g. G, PG, R, etc).
-- What is the average replacement cost per MPAA rating?

-- Answer:
SELECT rating,ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost),2)
FROM film
GROUP BY rating

-- Situation 3:
-- We are running a promotion to reward out the top 5 customers with coupons.
-- What are the customer IDs of the top 5 customers by total spend?

-- Answer:
SELECT customer_id,SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
LIMIT 5;
